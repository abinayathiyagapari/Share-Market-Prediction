share market prediction using linear regression

Linear regression is a method used to model a  relationship between a dependent variable (y), and an independent variable (x). With simple linear regression, there will only be one independent variable x. There can be many independent variables which would fall under the category of multiple linear regression. In this circumstance, we only have one independent variable which is the date. The date will be represented by an integer starting at 1 for the first date going up to the length of the vector of dates which can vary depending on the time series data. Our dependent variable, of course, will be the price of a stock. In order to understand linear regression, you must understand a fairly elementary equation you probably learned early on in school.

Using linear regression the share will be predict only if it grows linearly,but in share market as we know its not possible of predicting like that..

LONG SHORT TERM MEMORY
Here I used LSTM for predicting share ..
LSTMs are very powerful in sequence prediction problems because theyâ€™re able to store past information. 
This is important in our case because the previous price of a stock is crucial in predicting its future price.
